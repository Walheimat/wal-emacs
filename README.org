* About

** Heads-Up

This project is my personal literate Emacs (29.0.50)[fn:1]
configuration.

If you're a complete beginner, you will find [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#starter-kit][more user-friendly and
less tailor-made configs]] out there.

Feel free to consider it a jumping-off-point for your own custom
config. Just know that nothing in this config should be considered
/good practice/, it's mostly just how I (think I) like things to be.

** Try-Out

If you're interested in trying out Emacs using my config, here are the
necessary steps:

+ Install Emacs if you haven't[fn:2]
+ =git clone= this repository into your =user-emacs-directory=[fn:3]
+ load file =setup/wal-setup.el=, select =init file= and choose =link= or
  =copy=
+ close and re-run Emacs which should (download and) install all[fn:4]
  packages.

If you do not wish to =clone= this repo in your =user-emacs-directory= or
use the default name, you will need to adapt the variable
=wal/emacs-config-default-path= in the example init file you just
copied.

You can then use =customize-group= to change settings for various
aspects of the config.

** Peculiarities

*** Daemon Mode

This config is /daemon-ready/, i.e. if you start Emacs with the =--daemon=
flag, the config will make sure that any customization that requires a
frame will only be loaded once a frame was created.

A =systemd= service config can be found in the =/templates= directory to
get you started:

+ Run =mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user=
+ run =cp ./templates/emacs.service ~/.config/systemd/user=
+ adapt that =emacs.service= file to point to the correct path
+ run =systemctl --user enable emacs=.

Or you just execute =emacs --daemon= in a terminal or your shell's
config.

In any case, an Emacs daemon will start (on start-up). To connect, you
can use, for example, =emacsclient -c -n=[fn:5].

*** Package-Like Scope

Custom functions and variables use the =wal/= scope and belong to their
respective section's package.

With a few exceptions, each package has a *Header* and a *Footer* that
contains declarations for the package, as well as either a *Packages*
section or several sections grouping packages.

Enough preambling, let's configure some Emacs. The init script will
evaluate /everything/[fn:6] that follows.

Before =use-package= macro can be used to configure other packages it
and some other packages need to be installed the hard way.

*** Dir Local Indentation

Sometimes you have to play using other people's rules. You can run
=add-dir-local-variable= to do so. Check out the =.dir-locals.el= template
found in the =/templates= folder for an example using spaces.

** Prefix Keys

*** Control

There are some non-standard control sequences. Anywhere:

+ =C->=/=C-<= expands/contracts region
+ =C-.= marks next like this allowing
  + =C-,= to delete last mark and
  + =C-/= to move it downward
+ =C-o= deletes (while =M-o= moves to) other windows
+ =C-?= redoes (as =C-/= undoes).

User-reserved combinations are used for certain command maps:

+ =C-c 8= for =kubernetes=
+ =C-c b= for =bookmark= and
+ =C-c k= for =kmacro.=

It's also used for certain dispatches:

+ =C-c a= for =org-agenda=
+ =C-c d= for =docker=.

*** Hyper

Most hyper[fn:9] bindings are quick-access actions:

+ =H-h= finds file using =projectile= (or =counsel-projectile=)
+ =H-i= switches perspective (when using =perspective=)
+ =H-j= switches buffer using =consult= (or =counsel=)
+ =H-l= jumps to line (and =H-k= to word in line) with =avy=
+ =H-<mouse3>= adds another =multiple-cursor= at point
+ =H-n=, if chosen, searches with =ag= (a =hydra=)
+ =H-p= switches projects using =projectile=
+ =H-<return>= completes at point using =company= (in =company-mode=)
+ =H-== to do a =quick-calc= (inserted if called with =C-u=)
+ =H-\= toggles =vterm=
+ =H-u= toggles pop-ups using =popper= (or runs a =hydra= if focusing a pop-up)
+ =H-y= expands snippets (in =yas-minor-mode=).

It's also used for some dispatches:

+ =H-m= dispatches =magit-status=
+ =H-n=, if chosen, dispatches =rg-menu=
+ =H-o= dispatches =ace-window=.

**** Caps to Hyper

I re-bound my =<CAPS>= (caps-lock) key to =Hyper_L= to use the hyper
bindings above. Therefore, all following keys should be right hand
keys.

If you use Xorg Display Server, the risky quite[fn:10] way would be to
edit your =/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc= file like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC
...
// key <CAPS> {    [ Caps_Lock     ]   };
key <CAPS> {    [ Hyper_L       ]   };
...
// modifier_map Lock   { Caps_Lock };
modifier_map Mod3   { Hyper_L, Hyper_R };
...
// modifier_map Mod4   { <HYPR> };
modifier_map Mod3   { <HYPR> };
#+END_SRC

A safer alternative might be to create an =.xsession= file in your home
folder containing the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
xmodmap -e "keysym Caps_Lock = Hyper_L" \
		-e "remove Mod4 = Hyper_L" \
		-e "add Mod3 = Hyper_L"
#+END_SRC

This assumes that =Hyper_L= was assigned to modifier =Mod4= that's already
used by =Super_L= and modifier =Mod3= is an empty group. I haven't gotten
this safer alternative to work for me.

** Leader Keys

The are five multi-purpose =general= leader keys. They prefix actions by
common context.

*** Prefixes

Leader key =general= (=<,>= by default) prefixes Emacs actions like
loading a theme, finding a library, quitting as well as opening =eshell=
and =eww=.

Leader key =colonel= (=<;>= by default) provides an additional
quick-access actions.

Leader keys =major= and =captain= (=<.>= and =</>= by default) prefix
mode-specific actions, for major and minor modes respectively.

The =captain= prefixes, assuming the respective mode is on, are:

+ =d= for =dap-mode=
+ =f= for =flycheck= or =flymake=
+ =i= for =perspective=
+ =l= for =lsp-mode= or =eglot=
+ =m= for =smerge=
+ =p= for =projectile=
+ =s= for =flyspell=
+ =t= for =treesitter=
+ =w= for =winner=
+ =y= for =yasnippet=.

Leader key =lieutenant= prefixes non- or semi-mode package actions. The
package prefixes are:

+ =.= for =multiple-cursors=
+ =h= for =hungry-delete=
+ =l= and =r= for =avy= (line and region)
+ =m= for =magit=
+ =p= for =smartparens= (a =hydra=)
+ =u= for =consult=
+ =x= for =crux=
+ =z= for =org-roam=.

All leader keys have sinks. The sinks for =major= and =captain= toggle
major and minor modes. The sink for =lieutenant= provides some
additional useful commands.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Jumped ship from =27.1=. Some minor things might not work there.

[fn:2] If you're feeling adventurous, [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL][build from source]].

[fn:3] If you're not sure where your =user-emacs-directory= might be,
you can do the following:

+ Run Emacs
+ hit =M-x= (that is your Alt/Option key followed by the letter =x=)
+ type =describe-variable= and hit return
+ type =user-emacs-directory= and hit return again.

A window should pop up telling you the path.

Finally run =git clone git@gitlab.com:Walheimat/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d=
(replace =~/.emacs.d= with your actual path if it differs).

[fn:4] This includes this very config which will be exported as a
package collection.

[fn:5] Which means that a frame is created and control immediately
returned.

[fn:6] Not including where =:tangle no= was set.

/Note/ they will not necessarily be evaluated in the same order they
appear in this file. The order of evaluation is determined by the
=wal.el= file from [[*Config Package][this section]].

[fn:7] Send me an email, why don't you?

[fn:8] To get a full overview you'll have to call
=describe-personal-keybindings= and =general-describe-keybindings=.

[fn:9] If hyper can't be used (or shouldn't be used if Emacs is run in
=no-window-system=), it is replaced by =C-c w <key>= for both leader keys
and other bindings.

[fn:10] Be careful! If you make a mistake you could render your
keyboard unusable.

[fn:11] The following packages (and their related or sub-packages) are
found in other sections

- =org= and =org-agenda= in [[*Org Mode][Org Mode]]
- =flymake= and =flyspell= in [[*Fixing Things][Fixing Things]]
- =dired= in [[*Dired][Dired]]
- =eshell= in [[*Terminal][Terminal]]
- =python=, =emacs-lisp=, =cc-mode= and =css-mode= in [[*Languages][Languages]]

[fn:12] The =all-the-icons= icons need to be downloaded manually by
running =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= and selecting =yes=.

If the installation process should fail for any reason, close Emacs
and re-run it.

[fn:13] You might have to call =emojify-download-emoji= to download a
set that supports your emojis.

[fn:14] We will try to download it automatically, but might fail.

[fn:15] If you're on an older distro your =libvterm= package might be
too old.

[fn:16] All languages listed [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/][here]].

[fn:17] Mostly from MELPA. /Note/ that many packages bind keys. Check
the [[*Key Bindings][key bindings section]] if you need a list of the important ones, in
that section you also find package configurations for
key-binding-related packages =general= and =hydra=.
