* About

** Heads-Up

This project is my personal literate Emacs[fn:1] configuration.

If you're a complete beginner, you will find [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#starter-kit][more user-friendly and
less tailor-made configs]] out there.

Feel free to consider it a jumping-off-point for your own custom
config. Just know that nothing in this config should be considered
/good practice/, it's mostly just how I (think I) like things to be.

** Try-Out

If you're interested in trying out Emacs using my config, here are the
necessary steps:

+ first
  + install Emacs[fn:2] if you haven't
  + =git clone= this repository into your =user-emacs-directory=[fn:3]
+ in Emacs
  + =M-x load-file= and navigate to =setup/wal-setup=
  + =M-x =wal/setup=, select =init file= and choose =link= or =copy=
  + finally close and re-run Emacs with the =--ensure= flag which should
    install all[fn:4] packages and load the config[fn:5]

You can then use =customize-group= to change settings for various
aspects of the config.

** Peculiarities

*** As a Daemon

This config is /daemon-ready/, i.e. if you start Emacs with the =--daemon=
flag, the config will make sure that any customization that requires a
frame will only be loaded once a frame was created.

You can install either a =systemd= service using =wal/setup= (described
above) or just execute =emacs --daemon= in a terminal or your login
shell's configuration.

In any case, an Emacs daemon will start (on start-up). To connect, you
can use, for example, =emacsclient -c -n=[fn:5].

Custom functions and variables use the =wal/= scope[fn:6] and belong to
their respective [[file:lib][library]]'s package. Many libraries define a group for
customization purposes.

With a few exceptions, each library has a *Header* and a *Footer* that
contains declarations for its package, as well as either a *Packages*
section or several sections grouping packages.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] I use this config with Emacs 29. There's no guarantee below works
although some effort is made that it may with a few tweaks. VC
packages require 29 since they depend on =package-vc-install=.

[fn:2] If you're feeling adventurous, [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL][build from source]].

[fn:3] If you're not sure where your =user-emacs-directory= might be,
you can do the following:

+ Run Emacs
+ hit =M-x= (that is your Alt/Option key followed by the letter =x=)
+ type =describe-variable= and hit return
+ type =user-emacs-directory= and hit return again.

A window should pop up telling you the path.

Finally run =git clone git@gitlab.com:Walheimat/emacs-config.git
~/.emacs.d= (replace =~/.emacs.d= with your actual path if it differs).

If you do not wish to =clone= this repo in your =user-emacs-directory= or
use the default name, you will need to adapt the variable
=wal/emacs-config-default-path= in the example init file you just
copied.

[fn:4] Packages that belong to an expansion pack (mainly
language-specific packages) or its extras need to be installed
manually by calling =wal/install-expansion-pack=.

[fn:5] The configuration is subdivided into several libraries/packages.
The order of evaluation of the libraries is determined by the [[file:setup/wal-prelude.el][prelude]]
which is the file loaded in the =init.el= you just copied/linked.

[fn:6] There are some exceptions, like the macro =harpoon= to create hook
functions and the =general= definers for leader keys.
