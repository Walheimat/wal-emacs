#+TITLE: Bindings

* Prefix Keys

** Control

There are some non-standard control sequences. Anywhere:

+ =C->=/=C-<= expands/contracts region
+ =C-.= marks next like this allowing
  + =C-,= to delete last mark and
  + =C-/= to move it downward.

User-reserved combinations are used for (mostly built-in) commands
and command maps:

+ =C-c a= for =org-agenda=
+ =C-c d= opens the =dashboard=
+ =C-c m= for =bookmark=
+ =C-c n= to take notes for current =org-clock= task (go-to with =C-u 0=)
+ =C-c p= for =wal/project-<command>= prefix map
+ =C-c q= to do a =quick-calc= (inserted if called with =C-u=)
+ =C-c r= for =smerge=
+ =C-c s= for =flyspell=
+ =C-c <SPC>= for a heavy =pulse=
+ =C-c x= opens a scratch buffer (can be called with numeric argument).

** Hyper

I [[file:hyper.org][re-bound]] my =<CAPS>= (caps-lock) key to =Hyper_L= to
use the hyper bindings below. Therefore, all following keys should be
right hand keys.

Most hyper[fn:1] bindings are quick-access actions:

+ =H-h= finds project file
+ =H-i= loads register
+ =H-j= switches buffer
+ =H-k= acts on the current point with =embark= (immediately if called
  with =C-u=)
+ =H-l= jumps to line with =avy= (beginning of line if called with =C-u=)
+ =H-m= for =magit-status=
+ =H-<mouse3>= adds another =multiple-cursor= at point
+ =H-n= searches project with =rg= (=C-u= searches using regex)
+ =H-o= stores register
+ =H-p= switches projects
+ =H-u= jumps to word with =avy= (within line if called with =C-u=)
+ =H-{up,down,left,right}= moves with =windmove= (swap with shift, delete
  with meta, and prep display with control).

* Leader Keys

There are seven leader keys (three of them =general= leaders), each
serving its unique purpose by prefixing (groups of) actions by common
context or scope.

The =general= leader keys have so-called sinks for additional commands.

** Administrator

Leader key =administrator= is responsible for Emacs actions like loading
a theme, finding a library, quitting, as well as opening built-in
programs like =eshell= and =eww=.

** Whaler

Leader key =whaler= is responsible for this configuration.

** Roamer

Leader key =roamer= invokes a dispatch for =org-roam=.

** Ambassador

Leader key =ambassador= deals with the (buffer-, project-)local context.

If the respective buffer-local =minor-mode= is active, the following
commands and command maps are bound:

+ =8= for =kubernetes=
+ =b= for =dap-mode=
+ =d= for =docker=
+ =f= for =flycheck=
+ =@= for =mu4e=
+ =l= for =lsp-mode=
+ =m= for a =magit= menu
+ =n= for an =rg= menu
+ =v= for =verb=.

** Major

Leader key =major= invokes a dispatch if the underlying major-mode has
it defined.

** Consult

Leader key =consult= is a command map for the package of the same name.

** Editor

Leader key =editor= provides a layer of useful editing actions.

They are:

+ =c= to copy a line
+ =d= to duplicate lines (in Emacs 29)
+ =k= for to start/stop =kmacro= recording
+ =M-q= to "spill" a paragraph
+ =m= to move a line
+ =M-w= to kill-save whole buffer
+ =s= to correct with =jinx=
+ =.= to mark all "like this"
+ =w= to kill-save a line
+ =x= to kill a line.

The sink for =editor= provides alternative version of these calls.

They are:

+ =c= to copy a region
+ =m= to move a region
+ =s= to change =jinx= language
+ =.= to mark all ends in a region
+ =w= to kill a region
+ =x= to delete a region.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] If hyper can't be used (or shouldn't be used if Emacs is run in
=no-window-system=), it is replaced by =C-c w <key>= for both leader keys
and other bindings.
