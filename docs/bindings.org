#+TITLE: Bindings

* Prefix Keys

** Control

There are some non-standard control sequences. Anywhere:

+ =C->=/=C-<= expands/contracts region
+ =C-.= marks next like this allowing
  + =C-,= to delete last mark and
  + =C-/= to move it downward.

User-reserved combinations are used for (mostly built-in) commands
and command maps:

+ =C-c a= for =org-agenda=
+ =C-c d= opens the =dashboard=
+ =C-c m= for =bookmark=
+ =C-c p= for =wal/project-<command>= prefix map
+ =C-c q= to do a =quick-calc= (inserted if called with =C-u=)
+ =C-c r= for =smerge=
+ =C-c s= for =flyspell=
+ =C-c <SPC>= for a heavy =pulse=
+ =C-c x= opens a scratch buffer (can be called with numeric argument).

** Hyper

I [[file:hyper.org][re-bound]] my =<CAPS>= (caps-lock) key to =Hyper_L= to
use the hyper bindings below. Therefore, all following keys should be
right hand keys.

Most hyper[fn:1] bindings are quick-access actions:

+ =H-h= finds project file
+ =H-i= completes register
+ =H-j= switches buffer
+ =H-k= acts on the current point with =embark= (immediately if called
  with =C-u=)
+ =H-l= jumps to line with =avy= (beginning of line if called with =C-u=)
+ =H-m= for =magit-status= (shows full status if called with =C-u=)
+ =H-<mouse3>= adds another =multiple-cursor= at point
+ =H-n= searches project with =rg= (=C-u= shows full menu)
+ =H-p= switches projects
+ =H-u= jumps to word with =avy= (within line if called with =C-u=)
+ =H-y= to toggle pop-ups using =popper=.

It's also used for a dispatch:

+ =H-o= for =ace-window=.

* Leader Keys

There are seven leader keys (four of them =general= leaders), each
serving its unique purpose by prefixing (groups of) actions by common
context or scope.

By default, their scope matches how reachable they are, i.e. if a key
is easy to press, it has an inferior scope.

Some leader keys have so-called sinks for additional commands.

** General

Leader key =general= is responsible for Emacs actions like loading a
theme, finding a library, quitting, as well as opening built-in
programs like =eshell= and =eww=.

It also binds commands/maps in its sink:

+ =0= to =zone= out
+ =d= to look up word definitions
+ =o= to resize the window
+ =t= to scale text
+ =v= to scroll the /other/ window
+ =w= for =winner=.

** Colonel

Leader key =colonel= is responsible for this configuration.

** Trooper

Leader key =trooper= invokes a dispatch for =org-roam=.

** Major

Leader key =major= deals with the (buffer-, project-)local context.

If the respective buffer-local =minor-mode= is active, the following
commands and command maps are bound:

+ =8= for =kubernetes=
+ =b= for =dap-mode=
+ =d= for =docker=
+ =f= for =flycheck=
+ =-= for =consult-minor-mode-menu=
+ =+= for =consult-mode-command=
+ =@= for =mu4e=
+ =l= for =lsp-mode=
+ =r= for =org-roam=
+ =t= for =vterm=
+ =v= for =verb=.

** Captain

Leader key =captain= invokes a dispatch if the underlying major-mode has
it defined.

** Consult

Leader key =consult= is a command map for the package of the same name.

** Lieutenant

Leader key =lieutenant= provides a layer of useful editing actions.

They are:

+ =c= to copy a line
+ =d= to duplicate lines (in Emacs 29)
+ =i= for =iedit-mode=
+ =m= to move a line
+ =s= to open the scratch buffer (or create with =C-u=)
+ =.= to mark all "like this"
+ =w= to kill a line
+ =x= to delete a line.

The sink for =lieutenant= provides alternative version of these calls.

They are:

+ =c= to copy a region
+ =d= to dwim-duplicate
+ =h= to mark a region
+ =m= to move a region
+ =.= to mark all ends in a region
+ =w= to kill a region
+ =x= to delete a region.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] If hyper can't be used (or shouldn't be used if Emacs is run in
=no-window-system=), it is replaced by =C-c w <key>= for both leader keys
and other bindings.
